# Transfer learning for non-intrusive load monitoring (energy disaggregation)
This code implements the sequence-to-point (seq2point) learning model which was propsoed in [2]. The code then implements transfer learning for NILM. Precisely, we studied transfer learning for NILM using the seq2point learning framework. 

## Note: the latest seq2point leaning code using TensorFlow-2.0 can be found here https://github.com/MingjunZhong/seq2point-nilm ##

We proposed two approaches for transfer learning: 

[1] One is cross-domain transfer learning where you we want to transfer knowledge from domain to domain, for example, we can train a model on UK data and transfer the trained model to US households; 

[2] The other is appliance transfer learning where you want to transfer learned knowledge from appliance to applaince, for example, we can train a model on Washing Machine and then transfer it to Kettle. For more details, see the paper [1].

This code is written by Michele D'Incecco and Mingjun Zhong based on the code from
https://github.com/MingjunZhong/NeuralNetNilm

## **Create REFIT, UK-DALE or REDD dataset**

This script allows the user to create CSV files of training dataset of power measurments.
The output will be 3 CSV files for training, validation and test. 

You should select the following arguments for the argument parser:
`python create_dataset -h`

```
--data_dir DATA_DIR             The directory containing the CLEAN REFIT data

--appliance_name APPLIANCE_NAME which appliance you want to train: kettle,
                                microwave,fridge,dishwasher,washingmachine

--aggregate_mean AGGREGATE_MEAN Mean value of aggregated reading (mains)

--aggregate_std AGGREGATE_STD   Std value of aggregated reading (mains)

`--save_path SAVE_PATH           The directory to store the training data
```


Example:

Create a REFIT dataset (mains and appliance power measurments) for kettle:

`python create_dataset.py --data_dir './' --appliance_name 'kettle' --aggregate_mean 522 --aggregate_std 814 --save_path './'`

## **Training**
The seq2point_train.py script is the entry point for the training phase. It loads the training dataset, including validation, and it starts the training.
It uses a script to load CSV dataset file into memory, prepares pairs of 599 samples aggregate data and 1 sample midpoint ground truth.
After randomly shuffle them, batches of BATCHSIZE size are input to the network for backpropagation purpose.
Once the training is cmplete, according to the eary stopping criterion, the trained KERAS model (and model's parameters) will be available into the folder you have selected.

Training default parameters:

* Input window: 599 samples

* Number of maximum: epochs 50

* Batchsize: 1000

* Early stopping
    * min epochs: 5
    * patience: 5

* Adam optimiser:
    * Learning rate: 0.001   
    *  Beta1:  0.9
    *  Beta2: 0.999    
    *  Epsilon: 10^{-8}

`python seq2point_train.py --appliance_name 'kettle' --datadir './dataset_management/refit/' --save_dir './trained_model' --transfer_model False --crop_dataset 10000`

Transfer learning: train the whole model, starting from a pre-trained model: you must provide the pre-trained model directory (kettle in this example).

`python seq2point_train.py --appliance_name 'kettle' --datadir './dataset_management/refit/' --save_dir './trained_model' --transfer_model True --pretrainedmodel_dir './pretrained_model' --crop_dataset 10000`

Transfer learning: only train the dense layers starting from a pre-trained CNN; you must provide the pre-trained model directory (washingmachine in this example).

`python seq2point_train.py --appliance_name 'kettle' --datadir './dataset_management/refit/' --save_dir './trained_model' --transfer_cnn True --cnn washingmachine --pretrainedmodel_dir './pretrained_model' --crop_dataset 10000`

## **Test**
The seq2point_test.py script is the entry point for testing the network. In a similar way to the training windows are prepared, without shuffling, and sent to the network.
The prediction is stored and saved in .npy file together with aggregate and ground truth. If selected, the script will generate a plot (an example below).

Transfer learning (Testing on kettle, but the CNN was trained by using washing machine):

`python seq2point_test.py --appliance_name 'kettle' --datadir './dataset_management/refit/' --trained_model_dir './trained_model' --save_results_dir './result' --transfer True --cnn washingmachine --crop_dataset 10000 --plot_results False`

# Issues
### Washing machine for REDD (source: http://redd.csail.mit.edu/data/low_freq.tar.bz2)
Building 1 as test dataset in the file redd_parameters.py, the label for washing machine is 19, but it is all zero. Instead, the correct channel number is 20.
